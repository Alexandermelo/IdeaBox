## IdeaBox

We're going to be following a project created by JumpStart Lab that will help you understand the process of building a web application.

> Every developer has more ideas than time. As David Allen likes to say "the human brain is for creating ideas, not remembering them." Let’s build a system to record your good, bad, and awful ideas.

> And let’s use it as an excuse to learn about Sinatra.

> [Jump Start Curriculum](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/idea_box.html#i0:-getting-started)

You're viewing this project on Github, a social network for developers from all over the world.

Here they are able to share code with each other and collaborate on ways to improve projects
of all languages and function.

We're going to use Github to collaborate on building the IdeaBox project and following through the guide.

## Getting Started

### 1. Sign up for Github

First you'll need to sign up for [**Github**](github.com/signup) which is **free** for **open source** projects.

**What Does Open Source Mean?**

> The term **"open source"** software is used by some people to mean more or less the same category as free software. 
> It is not exactly the same class of software: they accept some licenses that we consider too restrictive, 
> and there are free software licenses they have not accepted.

> However, the differences in extension of the category are small: nearly all free software is open source,
> and nearly all open source software is free.

> — [Free Software Foundation](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/categories.html)

### 2. Create Your Own "Fork"

Github has fantastic documentation about how to use the network and how to use the underlying tool of Git.

To get started you're going to want to create your own copy of this project, doing that is called **"forking"** a project.
