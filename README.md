## IdeaBox

We're going to be following a project created by JumpStart Lab that will help you understand the process of building a web application.

> Every developer has more ideas than time. As David Allen likes to say "the human brain is for creating ideas, not remembering them." Let’s build a system to record your good, bad, and awful ideas.

> And let’s use it as an excuse to learn about Sinatra.
